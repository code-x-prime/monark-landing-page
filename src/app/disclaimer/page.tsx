                            <p>
                                Trading in forex, stocks, commodities, cryptocurrencies, and other financial instruments carries a high level of risk. You may lose some or all of your invested capital. The risk of loss in trading can be substantial and may exceed your initial investment.
                            </p>

                            <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-foreground mb-3 mt-6">2.2 Market Volatility</h3>
                            <p>
                                Financial markets are highly volatile and unpredictable. Market conditions can change rapidly, and prices can move against your position, resulting in significant losses. Past market performance does not guarantee future results.
                            </p>

                            <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-foreground mb-3 mt-6">2.3 Leverage Risks</h3>
                            <p>
                                Trading with leverage amplifies both potential profits and losses. While leverage can increase returns, it also significantly increases the risk of substantial losses. You may lose more than your initial investment when trading with leverage.

                            <p>
                                There is no guarantee that you will achieve profits or success in trading, regardless of the education, training, or mentorship you receive. Trading success depends on numerous factors including market conditions, your skill level, risk management, and discipline.
